		<p>I've always had a passion for things over the years. Whether it was movies, TV shows or sports, I was
			entertained by it. But there is one thing that I really appreciate and that's motorsports.
			I think it is so cool to see so many different forms of cars drive across so many tracks around the world as
			well as the people who drive them too. With that said, this is my version of the fun times project that I'd like to call...motorsports!
