   <h2> Wizard of Oz</h2>
   

   <ul>
    

      <li>
 
       <p>In this film, <b>Dorothy</b> and her dog <b>Toto</b>, are caught in a <i>tornado's</i> path and somehow end up in the Land of Oz. Here she meets some <i>memorable</i> friends and foes. In her journey to meet the <b>Wizard of Oz</b> who everyone says can help her return home and possibly grant her new
friends their desires (a brain, heart and courage). Here are some interesting words used in the
film:</p>

     </li>

      </ul>


 <ul> 

   
    <li>

cataclysmic ‐ to inundate, flood, deluge

 <ul> 

   
    <li>
careworn ‐ showing the effect of grief or anxiety

 <ul> 

   
    <li>
caliginous ‐ black, misty, dark
    

  </li>

   </ul>

<ul> 

  <p> Some things were removed from the final film. One interesting removal was that the <b>Tin-Man</b> actually was made into a <b><i>beehive</b></i> by the <b>Wicked Witch,</b> as threatened by her when on the cottage roof.
