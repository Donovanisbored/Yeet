        <p>Valentines Day, a day in which many people around the world take time to show their appreciation for someone they love. Such as for a family member,
            significant other, or anybody else. But how did this day all start? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Many have said that it all began with Saint Valentine, during the third century in Rome. As Valentine served as a priest, he also performed marriages in private for those who were in love.
            This was due to Emperor Claudius II's decision to make men who were single into soldiers, instead of letting them become married and start a family. This all changed, when the Emperor had found out about Saint Valentine's secret, and it led to his death.

            Other stories about this special day for lovers have been made, but no one really knows about the true origins. One day, someone will be able to discover and reveal the real story about Valentines Day to the world, but for now, we will continue to listen and pass the ones we've heard about ftom the previous generations and tell about it to the new ones.
