<strong><center><h1>Definition of Cool</h1></center></strong>

<p>I'm  firm believer in the fact that every single one of us believes that we are in fact "cool."</p>

<hr>
<h4>Calculate Cool</h4>
<p>5% aspiration + 95% self-perception + 10% public awareness + 46% Indiviuality + 15% actions + 22% verbal + 99% what others think about you. Wait, this doesn't add up to 100% - but I guess that is my point. Coolness doesn't add up to 100 either.</p>

<em><h3>Ultimate Coolness</h3></em>
<p>Being as cool as I am, I am going to go out on a limb (cause that's what cool people do) and give you my hypothesis of ultimate coolness. Rest assured, the fact that I am starting my opinion makes me genuinely cool, but I did digress momentarliy. There is no real tangible coolness. </p>
